0.06    Tue Feb 17 23:18:05 2009
        Gold never goes into the inventory
        Throw a warning if we're throwing away an inventory item in an update
        Improved artifact handling
        Fix evolving charge (both items need to do the role)
        MooseX::Role::Matcher is recommended (but not used) in place of our
            horrible hack which is now gone
        Many fixes for equipment tracking
        Handle plural unidentified eggs
        Load all tracker classes
        new_item no longer does inventory tracking, since it could be a
            container slot
        Account for quantity in weight
        Remove some hacks that sneaked in for initial TAEB support
        Spoilers now track stackability, tin weight, corpse permanence
        You can't drop worn items

        Item->spoiler_values, maybe_is, remove_damage, throw_range

0.04    Sat Dec 6 01:12:36 2008
        Implementation of all the features I need is done!
        NetHack::ItemPool and its modules are now part of this dist

0.03    Sun Nov 16 03:00:00 2008
        Item->incorporate_stats_from(Item) and Item->is_evolution_of(Item)
            These are used to update items with obvious stats from newer copies
            of the same item. Such as when you look at your inventory again and
            notice your sword has increased in enchantment.
        Tests for charging (thanks arcanehl) and fixes
        Corpses are now a subtype of food

0.02    Wed Nov 12 22:54:18 2008
        Too much to list, biggest is addition of subtypes and plenty of
            internals cleanup

0.01    Fri Jul 04 07:42:41 2008
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
